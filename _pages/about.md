I am Rohit Agarwal, a 4th-Year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, UiT Tromsø, Norway. I work on building scalable AI architectures for complex biological systems. I work in the [Bio-AI](https://www.bioailab.org/) and [3DNanoscopy](https://www.3dnanoscopy.com/) Lab under the supervision of [Dilip K. Prasad](https://sites.google.com/site/dilipprasad/), [Alexander Horsch](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/alexander.horsch) and [Krishna Agarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/uthkrishth/krishnaagarwal).

I am interested in making dynamic deep learning models where the number of inputs to a model keeps changing with streaming data. I call them [Haphazard Inputs](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=R9CgBkeZ6Z). Along with these, I have experience in computer vision and natural language processing. Recently, I am also exploring large language models with a focus on continual learning and quantization.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
